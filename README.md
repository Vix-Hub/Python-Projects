# Python-Projects
Some of the projects we have made during our university courses. 

Numerical implementation of the variational method to solve the time independent Schrodinger equation: 
1) OndePianeOscill.py : Research of approximate wave functions and eigenvalues of the quantum harmonic oscillator by optimizing the eigenstates of an infinite potential well.
2) Buca_Infinita_Polinomi.py : Research of approximate wave functions and eigenvalues of the infinite square well by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem associated with the Hamiltonian matrix. The base used for the problem is not orthonormal. 
3) Finite_Well.py :  Research of approximate wave functions and eigenvalues of the finite potential well by solving the eigenvalue problem associated with the Hamiltonian matrix. The base used for the problem is composed by the eigenstates of the infinite square well. 
4) Progetto_Cibernetica.py: Optimization of the hyperparameters of a neural network (# of hidden layers, minibatch size and learning rate) that is used to classify a test dataset thought the use of an evolutionary algorithm. 

The modules required to run the code above are: Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, TensorFlow and Deap.
